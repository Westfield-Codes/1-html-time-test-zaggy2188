    <h1>Three Ways of Looking at Time</h1>
An expansion upon <a href="https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/perspective-time-linear-cyclical">The Perspective On Time.</a> 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Astronomers, archaeologists and theologians, among many others, have pondered the nature and meaning of “time.”  We all know what time is until someone asks us to define it.  During the pandemic, when people all over the world stayed at home for extended periods of time, we had nothing but time on our hands to ponder the nature of time as we perceive it. Is it linear, cyclical, or spiral?  While many people in the modern era seem to agree that time is linear, for most of humankind’s existence, time has been considered cyclical and rhythmic. 
<h3>Three Arguments</h3>
<ol>
<li>Time is Linear
<ul>
<li>Time is Irreversible</li>
<li>Time is Cumulative</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time is Cyclical
  <ul>
<li>Planets Mark Time</li>
<li>Seasons Mark Time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time is Spiral
  <ul>
<li>Both at Once</li>
<li>Holidays Happen</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>Time is Linear</h2>

<h3>Time is Irreversible</h3>
<p>It’s simply impossible to travel back in time. As living beings, we are born, we age, and we die, in that order. We know about the past, but we can’t, by definition, know about the future. This is because time is unidirectional. This is not perception, it’s physical reality. Things in our universe go from a state of order to a state of (increasing) disorder. My hot cup of tea becomes cold, it doesn’t heat up. A dead body decays, it doesn’t come back to life. Cars wear out.</p>  
<br>
<h3>Time is Cumulative</h3>
Time is linear because of the different and cumulative ways we can record and measure it. Our Smartphone stopwatches measure time in milliseconds. This may be an absurd level of precision for daily life, but it is increasingly important as we push the limits of human athletic performance. We can also measure time by counting the number of times the Earth goes around the Sun, just as humans have done for thousands of years.

<h2>Time is Cyclical</h2>
