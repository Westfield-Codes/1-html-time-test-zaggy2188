    <h1>Three Ways of Looking at Time</h1>
An expansion upon <a href="https://www.theperspective.com/debates/living/perspective-time-linear-cyclical">The Perspective On Time.</a> 
<h3>Introduction</h3>
Astronomers, archaeologists and theologians, among many others, have pondered the nature and meaning of “time.”  We all know what time is until someone asks us to define it.  During the pandemic, when people all over the world stayed at home for extended periods of time, we had nothing but time on our hands to ponder the nature of time as we perceive it. Is it linear, cyclical, or spiral?  While many people in the modern era seem to agree that time is linear, for most of humankind’s existence, time has been considered cyclical and rhythmic. 
<h3>Three Arguments</h3>
<ol>
<li>Time is Linear
<ul>
<li>Time is Irreversible</li>
<li>Time is Cumulative</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time is Cyclical
  <ul>
<li>Planets Mark Time</li>
<li>Seasons Mark Time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Time is Spiral
  <ul>
<li>Both at Once</li>
<li>Holidays Happen</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2>Time is Linear</h2>

<h3>Time is Irreversible</h3>
<p>It’s simply impossible to travel back in time. As living beings, we are born, we age, and we die, in that order. We know about the past, but we can’t, by definition, know about the future. This is because time is unidirectional. This is not perception, it’s physical reality. Things in our universe go from a state of order to a state of (increasing) disorder. My hot cup of tea becomes cold, it doesn’t heat up. A dead body decays, it doesn’t come back to life. Cars wear out.</p>  
<br>
<h3>Time is Cumulative</h3>
Time is linear because of the different and cumulative ways we can record and measure it. Our Smartphone stopwatches measure time in milliseconds. This may be an absurd level of precision for daily life, but it is increasingly important as we push the limits of human athletic performance. We can also measure time by counting the number of times the Earth goes around the Sun, just as humans have done for thousands of years.

<h2>Time is Cyclical</h2>

<br>
<h3>Planets Mark Time</h3>
The Earth, Moon, and Sun move in repeating patterns. All of our most common time measurement systems we use in daily life are cyclical: The repetition of 60 seconds into a minute, 60 minutes into an hour, 24 hours into a day, seven days into a week, (roughly) four weeks into a month, (roughly) three months into a season, and four seasons into a year.   
<br>
<br>
<h3>Seasons Mark Time</h3>
Until recently, the lives of agricultural, nomadic, and even urban peoples were governed by the endlessly repeating seasonal changes. Time as a linear concept (how many hours more?) versus a cyclic one (will we harvest before winter?) are a recent phenomenon when compared to the long-term existence of our species.  For at least 95% of our existence as a species, time was cyclical. That's what Stonehenge is about. 
<br>
<h2>Time is Spiral</h2>

<br>
<h3>Both at Once</h3>
A line implies one direction of motion ("Tomorrow is another day") and a cycle implies the repetition of identical events ("Happy New Year!"), but a spiral acknowledges both and goes further. Think of a spiral staircase or the stairs going up a fire tower: you are always traveling up (if you 're walking up a hill), and you are always traveling in circles (if looked at from the top) but each turn offers a new perspective on the landscape below and around. Think of water spiraling down a drain: it is different from a river or a waterfall.  
<br>
<h3>Holidays Happen</h3>
While certain patterns might recur (like the seasons), each one is distinct, shaped by the accumulated experiences of the previous loops and by changing conditions.   Although holidays and birthdays are cyclic (they mark cycles of the Earth around the Sun), they are also linear (you are older each time). 
<br>
<br>
The quality of "a birthday" includes "a time to celebrate the fact that you exist" (which should not only happen once a year, but we make sure to do it on the day you are born, so it happens at least once) and also "a time to reflect on your "growing up" (when you are young) or your aging (when you are old). So while aging is linear (you're not getting any younger) and a birthday is a cyclic pattern, "you on your birthday" is a spiral experience. 
<br>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
Humans have a complicated relationship with time. Our modern lives are structured by linear time and its precise measurement (so we can get to school on time, for example). However, our human ancestors, and some of our relatives today, live by a different understanding of time, one that is cyclical.  If we combine both into a spiral, we can see how the more things change, the more they stay the same.  How will you think about time over the holidays?
